## Reflection


### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

To ensure code functionality, I focus on using thorough testing methods throughout the the entire development process. Including writing and running unit tests, integration testing and automating testing as often as possible. In effort to make my software more secure, I follow best practices like validating user inputs and adhering to secure coding guidelines. This involves continuously learning to stay up to date on the best practices for maintaining secure software and regular code reviews. 

### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

First and foremost, understanding the user’s needs starts with clear and open communication. Gathering requirements through interviews, surveys and user stories allows me to identify what the user wants and needs from the software. I like to prioritize these requirements, maintaining open communication to ensure they are translated into functional features to meet the user’s needs. All throughout the development process, I gather feedback from users and clients, ensuring the program aligns with their expectations and resolves their issues.

### How do I approach designing software?

My approach to software design is one that is user centric at its core. I like to begin by outlining the requirements for the user and creating an outline for the design of the program, using things such as flowcharts and use cases to visualize the structure and workflow. I use a modular approach to design to allow for scalability and maintainability. Incorporating functions like feedback loops during the design phase helps me to refine the functionality of the program and address potential issues early on. Ultimately, I strive for a balance between functionality, efficiency, and user-friendliness, ensuring that I meet all of the user’s needs.
